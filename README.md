# Parcel Benchmark API/Web Interface

Github Action Repo: [parcel-bundler/parcel-benchmark-action](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel-benchmark-action)

This is the API and Web Interface used to store and display the various benchmarks that are being ran on the Parcel GitHub repository to ensure Parcel remains as fast as possible while also paying attention to the bundle size it produces.

This gives us an overview of how impactful a PR is towards the bundle size and performance for a set of benchmark applications without having to manually test this.
